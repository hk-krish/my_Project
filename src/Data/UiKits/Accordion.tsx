    <strong> Search engine optimization: </strong> Search engine optimization (SEO) is a method for improving the chances for a website to be found by search engines. Web design codes information in a way that search engines can read it. It can boost business because the site shows up on the top search result pages, helping people to find it. <br /> <br />
    <strong> Mobile responsiveness:</strong> Mobile responsiveness is the feature of a website that allows it to display on a mobile device and adapt its layout and proportions to be legible. Web design ensures sites are easy to view and navigate from mobile devices. When a website is well-designed and mobile-responsive, customers can reach the business with ease. <br />
    <br /> <strong> Improved sales:</strong>Increasing the number of items sold or acquiring more active customers are objectives of a compelling website. As web design reaches targeted customers and search engines, it helps the business make conversions on their site and improve its sales.
